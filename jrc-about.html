        <h2>About Fenix Wiles</h2>
        <p>I'm a <strong>full-stack developer and qualitative researcher</strong> passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and meaningful human experience. Currently a senior at The University of Texas at San Antonio with an expected graduation in May 2026, my work is under peer review at the International Journal of Qualitative Methods and The Journal of Autoethnography, exploring how AI can serve as a collaborative partner in research and creative processes.</p>
    
        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>My path has been anything but linear. From a successful sales career at AT&T (March 2022 - August 2024) to becoming a developer and researcher, I've always been driven by curiosity about how technology can enhance human potential rather than replace it.</p>
        
        <h3>Technical Expertise</h3>
        <p>I specialize in full-stack development with a focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modern web technologies and frameworks</li>
          <li>Database design and optimization</li>
          <li>Rapid prototyping and deployment</li>
          <li>User-centered design principles</li>
          <li>Solo development lifecycle management</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>My flagship project, <strong>Sonder</strong>, demonstrates this approach — a web application I developed in just one week that operationalizes academic research on recursive dialogue, making it accessible and useful in real-world contexts.</p>
    
        <h3>Research Focus</h3>
        <p>My academic work centers on <em>recursive methodologies</em> and AI-mediated inquiry. I'm particularly interested in how we can develop research frameworks that treat AI as a thinking partner rather than just a tool, exploring questions of co-authorship, reflexivity, and the epistemological implications of human-AI collaboration.</p>
        
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>I believe in <em>rigor without rigidity</em> — whether in code or research. The best solutions emerge from understanding both technical possibilities and human needs. My work aims to create bridges: between academia and industry, between human insight and computational power, between theory and practice.</p>
